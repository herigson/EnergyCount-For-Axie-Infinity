![alt text](https://github.com/herigson/EnergyCount-For-Axie-Infinity/blob/master/EnergyCount/Resources/Application.PNG)

This is my first application using windows forms,  i made it for help to control enemy energy on the game Axie Infinity.

The design was inspired by the game.

If you like it and want to help me to continue developing tools for the game, this is my address from the ronin wallet
